  "title": "Agentic Validation of the Metainformational Quantum Bridge (MQB) for SAT",
  "objective": "To rigorously test, benchmark, and analyze the MQB algorithm for SAT solving using a fully agentic, autonomous pipeline. The pipeline will compare MQB to MiniSat, generate plots, and auto-write a report, following the AI Scientist-v2 methodology.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "The MQB algorithm correctly identifies SAT/UNSAT status for a range of CNF formulas.",
    "MQB's decoded assignments are consistent with ground-truth SAT solutions.",
    "MQB matches or approaches MiniSat's performance on small-to-medium CNFs."

  "experiment_plan": {
    "pipeline_steps": [
      "Build matchgate graph from CNF",
      "Planarize with paired sign-cross gadgets (PSCG)",
      "Apply Kasteleyn orientation",
      "Decode SAT status and assignment via Pfaffian/matching",
      "Run MiniSat baseline and compare results",
      "Generate SAT/UNSAT comparison plots",
      "Auto-write Markdown report with results and analysis"
