## Chunk 7: Lines 2400–end
**Themes:**
- Final theoretical validation of Pfaffian decoding and the cross-gadget construction.
- Explicit discussion of remaining technical uncertainties and their impact.
- Formal introduction to the MQB approach, including the paired sign-cross gadget (PSCG) solution to the Gurjar barrier.
- Detailed theoretical background: holographic algorithms, perfect matchings, FKT algorithm, and planarity barriers.
- Starter code template for the MQB pipeline and engineering/experimental roadmap.

**Insights:**
- Pfaffian decoding is theoretically sound for perfect matching detection, provided ±1 edge weights are carefully assigned to avoid cancellation. The approach is rooted in Tutte's theorem and the isolation lemma, with deterministic or randomized weight assignment as fallback.
- The only remaining uncertainties are technical (sign assignment, rare edge cases, and empirical validation), not fundamental; fallback to randomized isolation ensures correctness if needed.
- The Gurjar et al. impossibility result for universal planarizing gadgets is circumvented by using *paired* sign-cross gadgets (PSCG), which collectively preserve the bijection for perfect matchings and maintain planarity.
- The MQB approach is positioned as a candidate for a polynomial-time reduction from SAT to perfect matching in planar graphs, with a full experimental and reporting pipeline outlined (including benchmarking against MiniSat and automated manuscript generation).
- The starter code provides a clear modular structure for implementation, with explicit TODOs for gadget construction, planarization, Kasteleyn orientation, and decoding.

## Synthesis and Recommendations (Update)
- The MQB document now presents a complete theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental framework, from foundational theory to practical validation and manuscript preparation.
- Immediate next steps: (1) Finalize and test the PSCG construction and sign assignment; (2) rigorously validate the Pfaffian decoding on large benchmark instances; (3) automate the benchmarking pipeline and reporting; (4) address remaining technical uncertainties through targeted experiments.
- The project is ready for large-scale empirical validation and external review.
