        "Abstract": "This study aims to optimize the BC-MELD (Body Composition MELD) models by systematically analyzing and integrating body composition parameters. Using two comprehensive datasets with classified and volumetric BCA parameters, we develop and validate improved predictive models for mortality in liver transplant candidates. Our approach includes three phases: optimization of existing BC-MELD-VA models, investigation of new BCA parameters, and final model selection with in-depth interpretation. The analysis particularly focuses on improving prediction accuracy while maintaining model interpretability.",
