        "Title": "Leveraging Pfaffian Decoding and Paired Sign-Cross Gadgets for Quantum-Inspired Algorithms in Planar Graphs",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Combining Pfaffian decoding with paired sign-cross gadgets (PSCG) can lead to significant advancements in quantum-inspired algorithms for solving NP-hard problems in planar graphs, potentially offering polynomial-time solutions by leveraging holographic transformations.",
        "Related Work": "Previous work has primarily focused on Pfaffian orientations for perfect matchings (Tutte's theorem, Kasteleyn's method) and the impossibility results by Gurjar et al. on universal planarizing gadgets. Recent advancements in holographic algorithms and the isolation lemma have paved the way for deterministic approaches. However, the integration of PSCG with Pfaffian decoding in a quantum-inspired algorithmic framework remains unexplored.",
        "Abstract": "This proposal explores the integration of Pfaffian decoding and paired sign-cross gadgets (PSCG) to develop quantum-inspired algorithms for solving NP-hard problems in planar graphs. Building on the theoretical foundations of holographic algorithms, perfect matchings, and the isolation lemma, we hypothesize that the combination of these techniques can lead to polynomial-time reductions from SAT to perfect matching in planar graphs. We will rigorously test the PSCG construction, validate Pfaffian decoding on large benchmark instances, and automate the benchmarking pipeline. Our approach aims to address remaining technical uncertainties and position the MQB method as a viable candidate for efficient problem-solving in quantum computing paradigms.",
